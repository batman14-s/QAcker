## High-quality diverse sentence Paraphraser.

This paraphraser is trained on custom dataset with pairs of paraphrased sentences that are diverse. Diverse here means that pairs of sentences are selected such that there is significant difference in word order or at least the paraphrased output differs by multiple word changes. T5 large model from Huggingface is used to train the paraphraser.

## 1. Installation
```
!pip install transformers==4.10.2
!pip install sentencepiece==0.1.96
```

## 2. Running the code
```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("ramsrigouthamg/t5-large-paraphraser-diverse-high-quality")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("ramsrigouthamg/t5-large-paraphraser-diverse-high-quality")

import torch
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
print ("device ",device)
model = model.to(device)


# Diverse Beam search

context = "Once, a group of frogs was roaming around the forest in search of water."
text = "paraphrase: "+context + " </s>"

encoding = tokenizer.encode_plus(text,max_length =128, padding=True, return_tensors="pt")
input_ids,attention_mask  = encoding["input_ids"].to(device), encoding["attention_mask"].to(device)

model.eval()
diverse_beam_outputs = model.generate(
    input_ids=input_ids,attention_mask=attention_mask,
    max_length=128,
    early_stopping=True,
    num_beams=5,
    num_beam_groups = 5,
    num_return_sequences=5,
    diversity_penalty = 0.70

)

print ("\n\n")
print ("Original: ",context)
for beam_output in diverse_beam_outputs:
    sent = tokenizer.decode(beam_output, skip_special_tokens=True,clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)
    print (sent)
```
